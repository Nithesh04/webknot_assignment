# Campus Event Management Platform

This project is a backend system built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQLite**.  
It is designed to handle campus events, where admins can create events and students can register, mark attendance, and share feedback.  
The aim of this prototype is to show how a complete event workflow can be tracked and reported in a simple but structured way.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash

npm start
```

For development with auto-reload, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server runs by default at: http://localhost:3000


📊 Database Overview
The database uses SQLite and is created automatically when the project starts.
It contains the following tables:

Colleges → stores college information

Students → basic student details with a link to their college

Events → event details such as title, type, date, and college

Registrations → which student registered for which event

Attendance → attendance status (present/absent)

Feedback → feedback ratings for each event (1–5 scale)

Foreign keys are enabled to keep relationships valid, and duplicate registrations are prevented.


🔗 API Routes
Events
POST /events → Create a new event

GET /events → View all events

GET /events/:id → Get details of a specific event

Registrations
POST /events/:id/register → Register a student to an event

GET /events/:id/registrations → List all students registered for an event

Attendance
POST /events/:id/attendance → Mark a student’s attendance

GET /events/:id/attendance → View attendance list of an event

Feedback
POST /events/:id/feedback → Submit feedback (rating 1–5)

GET /events/:id/feedback → Get feedback for an event

Reports
GET /reports/popularity → Events sorted by registration count

GET /reports/student/:id → Participation details of a student

GET /reports/top-students → Top 3 students by attendance

GET /reports/overview → Quick stats across events and students



🧪 Seed Data
The system includes default sample data for quick testing:

A few colleges (e.g., Engineering, Computer Science, Business)

Students linked to those colleges

Sample events

Prefilled registrations, attendance records, and feedback

### Error Handling
The API handles common issues such as:

Preventing duplicate registrations

Validating feedback ratings (must be between 1–5)

Rejecting invalid or missing input

Handling cases where a student or event doesn’t exist
